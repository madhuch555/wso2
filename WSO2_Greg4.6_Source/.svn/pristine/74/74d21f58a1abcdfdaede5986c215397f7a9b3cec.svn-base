ProjectProposalHandler Sample
-----------------------------
Introduction
============
The idea of this sample is to demonstrate how to use media type handlers.  The sample application is to process project proposals, so we'll be using a component that intercepts Registry put() requests with a particular "proposal" media-type.  The Handler will read the proposal and mark it as valid or not.  In order to be a valid proposal there should be a number of fields - if all of them are there then the handler will mark the proposal as valid.  If one or more fields are missing then the proposal would be invalid.

Steps
-----
1. Copy the 'org.wso2.carbon.registry.samples.handler-@product.version@.jar' into
	GREG_HOME/repository/components/dropins.

   You also can upload handlers through the administration console by visiting the Extensions --> Add menu.

2. Edit the registry.xml file which is in 'GREG_HOME/repository/conf' folder with the following xml snippet.

    	<handler class="org.wso2.carbon.registry.samples.handler.ProjectProposalMediaTypeHandler" methods="PUT">
        	<filter class="org.wso2.carbon.registry.core.jdbc.handlers.filters.MediaTypeMatcher">
           		 <property name="mediaType">pp</property>
       		</filter>
    	</handler>

   You also can add the handler configuration through the administration console by opening the
   'Handlers' configuration (Extensions --> Configure --> Handlers) menu and clicking on 'Add New Handler'.

3. Start the server.

4. Go to admin console.

5. Browse the resources tree and add a new resource by visiting Resources --> Browse menue.

6. Select the 'Upload content from file' from from the drop down list.

7. Select your project proposal and type the media type as 'pp' (you can use whatever the media type you prefer).

	Note:- Sample project proposals are available in "GREG_HOME/samples/handler/src/resources" folder.

8. And 'Add' it.

9. Browse to the added project proposal. You could see the Properties and the Tag have been added to the resource.
