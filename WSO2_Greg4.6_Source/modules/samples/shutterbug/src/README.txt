Shutterbug Sample
-----------------

Introduction
============
The idea of this sample is to demonstrate how to use the WSO2 Governance Registry to build real world applications. This sample is designed to be used to host a competition on the WSO2 Governance Registry that will select 12 images out of several hundreds of images to be published on a calendar. Each user will be allowed to upload up to 2 images, and can vote for 12 images. Finally the administrators can browse the images with the highest number of votes and decide on the winners.

Steps
-----
1. Deploy G-Reg on tomcat under a context named 'greg'. More information can be found at http://opensource-soa.blogspot.com/2009/03/deploying-wso2-registry-on-tomcat.html.

2. Copy org.wso2.governance.samples.shutterbug.ui/src/main/resources/web/shutterbug/resources/crossdomain.xml in to the tomcat's 'ROOT' context.

3. Copy the jars found in GREG_HOME/samples/shutterbug/bin to GREG_HOME/repository/components/dropins.

4. Set the Index Page URL in GREG_HOME/repository/conf/carbon.xml as follows.

<IndexPageURL>/carbon/shutterbug/shutterbug-ajaxprocessor.jsp</IndexPageURL>

5. Start the server.

6. Go to the admin console.
